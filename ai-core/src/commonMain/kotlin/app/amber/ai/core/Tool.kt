        `base_id` to modify an existing recipe. `base_id` may be `current` (the currently visible
        theme, including try-on) or an installed/builtin id from theme_pack_status. With `base_id`,
        every other field is a patch: omitted fields stay unchanged, and design/light/dark/gradient/
        components objects merge recursively. Supplying `patterns`, `gradient.colors`, or
        `gradient.darkColors` replaces that whole array. `null` only clears optional design,
        light/dark palette overrides, gradient, components, or a component property. A saved custom theme keeps its id and cannot
        be changed to another id. The first edit of a builtin derives a new custom id; use that
        returned id or `current` for later edits.
        Without `base_id`, create a new complete recipe and provide all nine fields: `id`,
        `display_name`, `paper`, `accent_hex`, `ink_hex`, `canvas_style`, `brand_mark`,
        `shortcut_icon_style`, and `chrome_typeface`. The `id` must be a new slug and cannot be builtin.
        Use the optional `design` object for separate light and dark palettes, per-mode gradients,
        a patterns array with up to three composable layers, and optional chrome geometry; nested
        design fields may be locally omitted when patching. Component-only patches work on builtin/legacy
        themes without inventing palettes: absent light/dark palettes inherit the existing paper colors.
        Newly supplied palette objects need all five color fields; gradients require both full palettes.
        Do not redesign fields the user did not request.
        Gradient colors and darkColors are separate light/dark ramps with 2...4 hex colors each.
        Palette foreground must keep at least 4.5:1 contrast against background and surface;
        mutedForeground must keep at least 3:1. Allowed paper is paper, neutral, white, pi,
        notion (no immersive). New recipes default canvas_scope to shell; edits keep the existing scope. Use appWide when the user asks
        for the design across the whole app. High-luminance accent_hex needs a dark ink_hex;
        contrast must be at least 3.0. Never claim you changed the theme until the user confirms 套用.
